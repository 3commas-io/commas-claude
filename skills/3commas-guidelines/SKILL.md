# 3Commas Organization Guidelines

ALWAYS prioritize using appropriate agents for all tasks.

## Git & Pull Requests
- All pull requests should start with a Jira task code (e.g., `PLTF-1234: Add feature`)
- Extract Jira task code from the current branch name

## Code Standards
- Follow existing project conventions
- Write tests for new functionality
- Never use float types for money and prices, always use Decimal
